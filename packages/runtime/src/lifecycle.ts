 * Note: the lifecycle object ensures that certain callbacks are executed in a particular order that may

 * {

 *   children: [
 *     { path: "1.1", children: [
 *       { path: "1.1.1" },
 *       { path: "1.1.2" }

 *       { path: "1.2.1" },
 *       { path: "1.2.2" }
 *     ]}
 *   ]
 * }
 * The call chain would be: 1 -> 1.1 -> 1.1.1 -> 1.1.2 -> 1.2 -> 1.2.1 -> 1.2.2
 *
 * During mounting, for example, we want to mount the root component *last* (so that the DOM doesn't need to be updated
 * for each mount operation), and we want to invoke the detached callbacks in the same order that the components were mounted.
 * But all mounts need to happen before any of the detach callbacks are invoked, so we store the components in a LinkedList
 * whose execution is deferred until all the normal $attach/$detach calls have occurred.
 * In the example of attach, the call chains would look like this:
 * $attach: 1 -> 1.1 -> 1.1.1 -> 1.1.2 -> 1.2 -> 1.2.1 -> 1.2.2
 * $mount: 1.1.1 -> 1.1.2 -> 1.1 -> 1.2.1 -> 1.2.2 -> 1.2 -> 1
 * attached: 1.1.1 -> 1.1.2 -> 1.1 -> 1.2.1 -> 1.2.2 -> 1.2 -> 1
 *
 * Instead of (without the lifecycles):
 * $attach: 1, $mount: 1, detached: 1 -> $attach: 1.1, $mount: 1.1, detached: 1.1 -> etc..
 *
 * Furthermore, the lifecycle object tracks the call depth so that it will automatically run a list of operations
 * when the top-most component finishes execution, and components themselves don't need to worry about where in the
 * tree they reside.
