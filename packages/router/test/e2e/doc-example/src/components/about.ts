Scroll me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On a-Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me
Fill my heart with song and
Let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I scroll you
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and I adore
In other words, please be true
In other words
In other words, I scroll you
