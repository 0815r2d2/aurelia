## Build and Test

### Runtime

To test the sample application:

* Install the `aurelia-cli` globally with `npm install -g aurelia-cli`
* Install the project dependencies with `npm install`
* Run the application with `au run --watch`

### Compiler

This project has a temporary dependency on `aurelia-path` and `aurelia-dependency-injection`. Those need to be manually `npm install`ed first.

* Build compiler

```shell
npm run build
```

* Test compiler

```shell
npm run test
```

* Build then test

```shell
npm run start
```

### Running the sample App

```shell
au run [--watch]
```

### Running the unit tests

* Single run

```shell
npm run karma
```

* Watch mode

```shell
npm run karma-watch
```

#### Debugging the unit tests from VS Code:


```shell
npm run karma-debug
```

- When karma is running, press the `DEBUG` button in the browser (will open a new tab);
- In VS Code start the debugger `Attach Karma Chrome`
- When prompted to select which tab, select `DEBUG`
- In VS Code, set a breakpoint in a `.ts` source file (src or test)
- `ctrl+s` / save to trigger a recompile (works even if there are no changes)
- Refresh the chrome `DEBUG` tab
- Your breakpoint should now be hit

By default no coverage is generated in debug mode.


#### Custom options (defaults are shown)

```shell
npm run karma -- --transpile-only=true --no-info=true --coverage=true --tsconfig=tsconfig-karma.json
```

For all standard karma options, see `karma start --help`

Installed browser plugins: `Chrome,ChromeHeadless,Firefox,InternetExplorer`

To see the generated test coverage, open `coverage/index.html` in a browser.
